# How To Upload Using Android Studio

1. I already added it but in the app.json file I must create a package with the app name
2. Since I used expo.cli, I can run 'expo build:android -t apk' in my terminal. This will start building my application on expo.dev
3. When it is done building, download the apk. I included it in the github repository
4. When it is finish downloading, open up android studio or any android emulator and launch the emulator
5. From there, you should be able to drag the apk file in the emulator and it will start installing
